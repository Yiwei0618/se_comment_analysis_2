On August 2nd, 2023, negotiations between community representatives and representatives of the company concluded with an agreement being reached. The details of the agreement can be found at Moderation strike: Results of negotiations.
On August 7th, 2023, based on the result of several polls held by various sections of the community, the coordinated call to strike concluded. Further details can be found at Moderation strike: Conclusion and the way forward.


Introduction
As of today, June 5th, 2023, a large number of moderators, curators, contributors, and users from around Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network are initiating a general moderation strike. This strike is in protest of recent and upcoming changes to policy and the platform that are being performed by Stack Exchange, Inc.1
We have posted an open letter addressed to Stack Exchange, Inc. The letter details which actions are being avoided, the main concerns of the signees, and the concrete actions that Stack Exchange, Inc. needs to take to begin to resolve the situation. Striking community members will refrain from moderating and curating content, including casting flags, and critical community-driven anti-spam and quality control infrastructure will be shut down.
However, the letter itself cannot contain all of our concerns, and we felt it was important to share some of the background and details that were not included in the letter in the interest of brevity. We also wanted to touch upon several points at the same time that are related to Stack Exchange, Inc.’s recent behavior.
Background
A history of the Artificial Intelligence policy
On December 5th, 2022, Stack Overflow moderators instituted a “temporary policy” banning the use of ChatGPT in particular on the site. This was instituted due to the general inaccuracy of the answers, as well as that such posts violate the referencing requirements of Stack Overflow. The moderator team kept an eye on community feedback to guide it, and support welled beneath this policy. Similar policies were enacted across the network.
Within the next several days, thousands of posts were removed and hundreds of users were suspended for violating this policy.
Over the next few months, Stack Exchange, Inc. staff assisted in the enforcement of this policy. This included adding a site banner announcing the ban on these posts as well as editing and adding Help Center articles to mention this policy. Moderators were also explicitly given permission to suspend for 30 days directly in such cases, skipping the escalation process that is generally encouraged.
On May 29th, 2023 (a major holiday for moderators in the US, CA, UK, and possibly other locations), a post was made by a CM on the private Stack Moderators Team2 (now publicly published). This post, with a title mentioning “GPT detectors”, focused on the rate of inaccuracy experienced by automated detectors aiming to identify AI- and specifically GPT-generated content - something that moderators were already well aware of and taking into account.
This post then went on to require an immediate cessation of issuing suspensions for AI-generated content and to stop moderating AI-generated content on that basis alone, affording only one exceptionally rare case in which it was permissible to delete or suspend for AI content. It was received extremely poorly by the moderators, with many concerns being raised about the harm it would do.
On May 30th, 2023, a version of this policy was posted to Meta Stack Exchange and tagged mod-agreement-policy, making this a binding moderator policy according to the Moderator Agreement. The policy on Meta Stack Exchange differs substantially from the version issued in private to the moderators. In particular, the public version of the policy conspicuously excludes the “requirements” made in private to immediately cease practically all moderation of AI-generated content.
The problem with the new policy on AI-generated content
The new policy, establishing that AI-generated content is de facto allowed on the network, is harmful in both what it allows on the platform and in how it was implemented.
The new policy overrode established community consensus and previous CM support, was not discussed with any community members, was presented misleadingly to moderators and then even more misleadingly in public, and is based on unsubstantiated claims derived from unreviewed and unreviewable data analysis. Moderators are expected to enforce the policy as it is written in private, while simultaneously being unable to share the specifics of this policy as it differs from the public version.
In addition to these issues in how Stack Exchange, Inc. went about implementing this policy, this change has direct, harmful ramifications for the platform, with many people firmly believing that allowing such AI-generated content masquerading as user-generated content will, over time, drive the value of the sites to zero.
A serious failure to communicate
Throughout the process of creating, announcing, and implementing this new policy, there has been a consistent failure to communicate on the part of Stack Exchange, Inc. There has been a lack of communication with moderators and a lack of communication with the community. When communication happened, it was one-sided, with Stack Exchange, Inc. being unwilling to receive critical feedback.
An offer by Philippe, the Vice President of Community, to hold a discussion in the Teachers’ Lounge moderator-only chatroom took days to be realized. During that conversation, certain concerns were addressed3, but the difficult questions remained unanswered – particularly about the lack of communication ahead of time.
The problem with AI-generated content
This issue has been talked about endlessly, both all around the Stack Exchange network and around the world, but we feel it’s important to highlight a few reasons why several communities, not just Stack Overflow, decided to ban AI-generated content. These reasons serve as the backbone not only for our moderation stance against AI-generated content, but also why we feel confused and betrayed by Stack Exchange, Inc.’s sudden decision to halt our efforts to enforce our community-supported decision to ban it.
To reference Stack Overflow moderator Machavity, AI chatbots are like parrots. ChatGPT, for example, doesn’t understand the responses it gives you; it simply associates a given prompt with information it has access to and regurgitates plausible-sounding sentences. It has no way to verify that the responses it’s providing you with are accurate. ChatGPT is not a writer, a programmer, a scientist, a physicist, or any other kind of expert our network of sites is dependent upon for high-value content. When prompted, it’s just stringing together words based on the information it was trained with. It does not understand what it’s saying. That lack of understanding yields unverified information presented in a way that sounds smart or citations that may not support the claims, if the citations aren’t wholly fictitious. Furthermore, the ease with which a user can simply copy and paste an AI-generated response simply moves the metaphorical “parrot” from the chatbot to the user. They don’t really understand what they’ve just copied and presented as an answer to a question.
Content posted without innate domain understanding, but written in a “smart” way, is dangerous to the integrity of the Stack Exchange network’s goal: To be a repository of high-quality question-and-answer content.
AI-generated responses also represent a serious honesty issue. Submitting AI-generated content without attribution to the source of the content, as is common in such a scenario, is plagiarism. This makes AI-generated content eligible for deletion per the Stack Exchange Code of Conduct and rules on referencing. However, in order for moderators to act upon that, they must identify it as AI-generated content, which the private AI-generated content policy limits to extremely narrow circumstances which happen in only a very low percentage of AI-generated content that is posted to the sites.
This isn’t just about the new AI policy
While a primary focus of the strike is the potential for the total loss of usefulness of the Stack Exchange platform caused by allowing AI-generated content to be posted by users, the strike is also in large part about a pattern of behavior recently exhibited by Stack Exchange, Inc.
The company has once again ignored the needs and established consensus of its community, instead focusing on business pivots at the expense of its own Community Managers, with many community requests for improved tooling and improving the user experience being left on the back burner. As an example, chat, one of the most essential tools for moderators and curators, is desperately out of date, with two-minute, high improvement changes being ignored for years.
Furthermore, the company has repeatedly announced changes that moderators deem would cause direct harm to the goals of the platform, this policy on AI-generated content among them. The community, including moderators and the general contributor base, was not consulted nor asked for input at any point before these changes were announced, phrased in a manner that indicated that there was no possibility of retraction or even a trial period.
Some of these planned changes have been temporarily held off due to controversy, this strike influencing those decisions, but that does not change the recent tendency of Stack Exchange, Inc. to make decisions affecting the core purpose of the site without consulting those most affected.
The events of the last few weeks seem like history repeating itself. Stack Exchange, Inc. ventures into a new pursuit, this time, generative AI, in contrast with the community’s interests, makes a decision at odds with all feedback available to them, ceases communications with us, and we go on strike. This is similar to what happened last time the community moderators prepared to go on strike.
How we resolve this
Even though the strike may end, many community members are not comfortable with returning to the status quo before the AI policy itself, if nothing else changes. The strike’s focus on the AI policy is not downplaying the significance of SE’s other actions. We deserve much more than just retracting the AI policy. Stack Exchange already made promises after the 2019 debacle that they have since failed to meet. We are worried that Stack Exchange will continue down the same path once the situation calms down.
While the recent actions by Stack Exchange, Inc. are in conflict with the community and take a significant step backward in terms of the relationship between the company and the community, we do not think that our relationship is beyond repair. We do however worry that we are nearing the point at which it cannot be repaired anymore.
While it certainly may be true that the company wants to meet our needs, and wants to care for us, the reality is that this is not happening. It is time to wake up and realize what must be done. Stack Exchange, Inc. is not acting in our interest. It is time to do so.
What the striking users want
For the strike to end, the following conditions must be met:

The AI policy change retracted and subsequently changed to a degree that addresses the expressed concerns and empowers moderators to enforce the established policy of forbidding generated content on the platform.
Reveal to the community the internal AI policy given directly to moderators. The fact that you have made one point in private, and one in public, which differ so significantly has put the moderators in an impossible situation, and made them targets for being accused of being unreasonable, and exaggerating the effect of the new policy. Stack Exchange, Inc. has done the moderators harm by the way this was handled. The company needs to admit to their mistake and be open about this.
Clear and open communication from Stack Exchange, Inc. regarding establishing and changing policies or major components of the platform with extensive and meaningful public discussion beforehand.
Honest and clear communication from Stack Exchange, Inc. about the way forward.
Collaborate with the community, instead of fighting it.
Stop being dishonest about the company’s relationship with the community.

A change in leadership philosophy toward the community
We need business leadership to meet minds with the community members and community managers, because currently, it appears that leadership ignores them.
Immediate financial concerns appear to drive feature development. The community also has feature development wants and needs, but no substantial consideration is given to those needs, let alone resource allocation. The lack of merit leadership gives to the community and CMs even leads to its own business decisions being reckless and harmful, like the AI policy.
Leadership needs a change in philosophy to one that treats the community as more than a product, and values its needs and expertise. Such a philosophy is evidently currently missing, and leadership takes the expertise of its own product for granted. Leadership needs to represent this philosophy in actually allocating resources based on community needs as well as its own, and informing its feature development using the expertise of the community. Development can be guided by both business and community needs!
In conclusion
The sites on the Stack Exchange network are kept running smoothly by countless hours of unpaid volunteer work, and, in some cases, projects paid for out of pocket by community members. Stack Exchange, Inc. needs to remember that neglecting and mistreating these volunteers can only lead to a decrease in the goodwill and motivation of those contributing to the platform.
A general moderation strike is being held until the concerns laid out in the open letter and this post are addressed. Moderators, curators, contributors, and users, you are welcome to join in by signing your name in the strike letter.

Updates
This post contains strike updates (representatives elected, reactions to the GPT data analysis posted by Philippe, conditions for ending the strike).

1 While we’re aware that the legal name of the company is “Stack Exchange, Inc.”, the name “Stack Overflow” is more recognizable, and thus used in the open letter. The “Inc.” serves to demonstrate that our concerns lie with the corporate entity, and not the site itself, its moderators, or individual employees.
2 Stack Exchange, Inc. provides a free Stack Overflow for Teams instance for Stack Exchange moderators, allowing moderators to store and share private information, bug reports, documentation, and communication with SO staff.
3 This includes another planned change to the foundational systems of the platform that has the potential to facilitate unprecedented levels of abuse.

answer,389844,389811,274022.0,sideshowbarker,512,"Background from a striking SO mod who handled 10000+ GPT flags
I’m a Stack Overflow moderator coming here to give more details on what management has said that’s helped cause me to decide to join the strike, and to give details from my own personal experience handling several thousand of the warnings and suspensions we’ve done at Stack Overflow for ChatGPT copy-paste abuse.
And I’m framing this as a response to a comment elsewhere from company management way back in December that now looks to have been an unintentional “tell” from management that they may have already started musing way back then about plans to frame it all as a misguided “witch hunt”.
So, to be very clear: The massive effort and hours the curators/flaggers and elected moderators spent together over the last 6 months very successfully stemming the ChatGPT copy-paste tide and shielding our community’s users from all that junk never in, any way shape or form, came anywhere close to actually resembling anything like a “witch hunt” or any other kind of malicious or hysterical misguided analogy that management might want to try to smear us with now.
The reality is instead this:
We’ve been very accurately identifying the ChatGPT posts with an extremely low number of false positives. And I say that as someone who has handled a very very large number of the flags.
For support of the assertion above, please really do take time to read on here.
(Non)Use of any detection tools
I want to take a moment here now to respond specifically to the continuing nonsense insinuations (smears) from management (repeated to the media even today) that we have been over-relying on various detection tools that “have an alarmingly high rate of false positives” and their “decision to require that moderators stop using that tool [sic]”.
So, let me make clear:
In the thousands of cases I handled, I never ever used any of the detection tools.
That is, not only did I not “over rely” on detection tools, I never relied on them at all.
And in cases where the flaggers had included scores from any detection tools in their flag comments, I even completely ignored whatever score information the flaggers provided — to the point that I would actually stop reading the flag comments at the point where they were providing score information, because I found no use at all for it.
So not only could it be said of me that I am one of the moderators whose “own analyses were in use as well” — I can say that my “own analysis” was exclusively in use, with zero reliance on any detector information.
Numbers and assertions
To help clear up any doubts on whether I know whereof I speak, here are some numbers:

Conservatively speaking, for the last 6 months (since the beginning of December 2022) every single day I have been spending 40 minutes a day just on moderating ChatGPT flags. That works out to 120 hours in total that I’ve personally spent on them so far.

And in those hours I’ve spent on this week after week, I’ve looked at multiple thousands of ChatGPT-flagged posts: in the order of 10000 or even 15000 at this point.


And so I do now assert that in the many hours I've spent actually looking at the ChatGPT-flagged posts, and from the many thousands of those posts that I have actually closely and carefully scrutinized in detail, I have in fact learned to recognize the ChatGPT copy-paste cases (including many of the ones whose content the posters had edited before pasting in, to intentionally obscure the provenance) and I can in fact say this:
I assert: I can, with a very high level of confidence and a very low level of false positives, very effectively identify answers whose provenance is ChatGPT or other AI.
And all that leads me to finish with an invitation…
An invitation to management
To anyone in management who claims the elected moderators have been getting it wrong for the last 6 months, with an unacceptably high rate of false positives, and who wants to challenge my personal assertions about how accurately I can identify the ChatGPT cases: I invite you to work together with me over several days looking at least several dozens of ChatGPT flags as they come in.
Alternatively, rather than looking at new flags as they come in, I invite anyone
to go together through the logs of my moderation activities, and examine some significantly-sized random sampling of the thousands of ChatGPT flags I have handled.
Either way, let’s spend time scrutinizing the actual content of the flagged posts together, and actually honestly talking together in good faith about which posts we think we can agree are highly likely not the poster’s own original work.
Until anybody who questions how well we’ve been handling the ChatGPT flags actually does something concrete like what’s described above, waving vague suggestions about possible “witch hunts” and other slanders around under the noses of the elected moderators and flaggers is completely irresponsible at best — but in reality, in combination with other indirect accusations and aggressions that key company reps driving company messaging around this have slung at the elected moderators, it is completely unconscionable and completely unprincipled.",,,,

Speaking for myself, this is not a good start.

The trigger for the current crisis was an instruction on Monday last
week (a public holiday) to Stack Overflow moderators in an official
but private forum,  “Moderators were informed, via pinned chat
messages in various moderator rooms (not a normal method), to view a
post in the Moderator Team that instructed all moderators to stop
using AI detectors (as outlined above) in taking moderation actions,”
said a post. The details of the instruction are not public. VP of
Community Philippe Beaudette posted that “AI-generated content is not
being properly identified across the network,” that “the potential for
false positives is very high,” and “internal evidence strongly
suggests that the overapplication of suspensions for AI-generated
content may be turning away a large number of legitimate contributors
to the site.” He said moderators had been asked to “apply a very
strict standard of evidence to determining whether a post is
AI-authored when deciding to suspend a user.” However, the moderators
claim that a description of the policy posted by Beaudette “differs
greatly from the Teams guidance … which we’re not allowed to publicly
share.”

There is no evidence that this is true.
Although there is evidence that some detectors have false positives, this shouldn't be news to moderators and is something that has been discussed. It's why we don't rely exclusively on the detectors, but on other moderator tooling as well as our experience and expertise with the content on each of our communities.
I also don't see evidence that the people posting generated content are legitimate contributors. Of the people that I personally suspended, 1 had previous positive contributions. When someone is suspended, they can also appeal by responding to the moderator message. No one did. I can't speak for all moderators on all sites, but my understanding is that the number of accounts with prior positive contributions and accounts that responded to suspensions is low.

In a statement sent to Dev Class, Stack Overflow’s CEO Prashanth
Chandrasekar told us:
“A small number of moderators (11%) across the Stack Overflow network
have stopped engaging in several activities, including moderating
content. The primary reason for this action is dissatisfaction with
our position on detection tools regarding AI-generated content.
“Stack Overflow ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools that
moderators were previously using have an alarmingly high rate of false
positives. Usage of these tools correlated to a dramatic upswing in
suspensions of users with little or no prior content contributions;
people with original questions and answers were summarily suspended
from participating on the platform. These unnecessary suspensions and
their outsize impact on new users run counter to our mission and have
a negative impact on our community.
“We stand by our decision to require that moderators stop using the
tools previously used. We will continue to look for alternatives and
are committed to rapid testing of those tools.
“Our moderators have served this community for many years, and we
appreciate their collective decades of service. We are confident that
we will find a path forward. We regret that actions have progressed to
this point, and the Community Management team is evaluating the
current situation as we work hard to stabilize things in the short
term,” he added.

The number of moderators may be small, but includes the most engaged moderators across some of the most active sites on the network. It also discounts the impact of deactivating various notification tools and anti-spam bots that users run on new posts to mitigate their impact. The statement trivializes who is participating and what this participation will look like to visitors to the platform.
I don't think that the position on detection tools is the issue. Moderators have known, since the very beginning, about the limitations in the tools used to detect algorithmically-generated content. The tipping point was, from my perspective, how the policy was unveiled. Per the Moderator Agreement, policies are supposed to be reviewed by moderators on the Moderator Team prior to being made public. Although the agreement doesn't say how long the review period is, a day of review that starts on a holiday in the US, Canada, UK, and other countries doesn't seem to be consistent with the spirit of the agreement. In addition, the post on the Moderator Team was a decree or edict and not an opportunity to give feedback. However, this is just one in a trend of announcing fundamental platform and policy changes without appropriate feedback.
Although I don't doubt that, across the network, there were a large number of accounts with few (or no) contributions suspended, this policy is far more forgiving than our policies to deal with spammers. I moderate two smaller sites on the network, where we had less than 10 accounts suspended for posting algorithmically-generated content. Only 1 had meaningful contributions previously. If they had posted spam, the majority of the accounts would have been destroyed, which would have also fed into anti-spam measures. If there was a human behind these accounts, there's a (small) possibility that they have learned a lesson and contributed in the future. However, my suspicion is that these accounts were created only to post generated content and there was minimal loss by suspending these accounts. If the problem was indeed the suspensions, then I know that I would have agreed to end the policy of immediately jumping to 30-day suspensions (which was something promoted by the staff), and I suspect other moderators would have as well.
Personally, it seems like leadership at the company doesn't understand where we're coming from or what we want. And that is the first fundamental step to take.",,,,

A Strike song for some inspiration...
Having said that, I think the demands do not go nearly far enough. Like the opening post here said, this is much larger than the AI decision; it's about the entire relationship of the company to the community and network of sites.
I call on the striking moderators to demand the following:

Formal declaration by SE Inc. recognizing the Stack Exchange network as a public resource, irrespective of its private ownership of servers, code, databases, copyrights, etc. And of SE Inc.'s relation to the network being foremost, though not exclusively, that of a trustee. (Yes, this should have legal ramifications.)
Acceptance of a community veto power on network policy changes, the details of which the moderators should flesh out either as part of their demand or to be worked out in negotiations.
A third-party ombudsman for information disclosure will be appointed, agreed upon by the company and the moderators (mechanism for such agreement to be worked out), who will have full and unrestrained access to all company documents and information, excluding employees' personal affairs and correspondence, and will have the authority and the obligation to disclose all such information which is deemed relevant to the network.
Accountability for SE Inc. management vis-à-vis the community (collectively or individually)—a formal obligation, via SE Inc. company bylaws/charter or a binding agreement with the delegates of the moderators, to publicly answer, on Meta.SE, collective queries from the moderators, with full and complete answers (with exact mechanism to be worked out by moderators vis-a-vis management).

Whether these demands are a condition for ending your strike or not, that's entirely up to you. But I believe that is the kind of relationship change we need to see on this network (and I may not have even gone far enough).",,,,

The first company response on Meta Stack Exchange was incredibly underwhelming.

As you may be aware, a number of moderators (on Stack Overflow/across
the network) have decided to stop engaging in several activities that
they had taken on, including moderating content - in fact, almost all
moderation tasks. The primary reason for this action is
dissatisfaction with our position on detection tools regarding
AI-generated content, and discontent with how that was rolled out.

This is an accurate assessment. Personally, I'm more discontented with how the position/policy was rolled out. Having an appropriate discussion with moderators and then the community, as it's laid out in the Moderator Agreement, would have been better, even if the result was the same policy.

We ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly
highly high rate of false positives, which is correlated to a dramatic
upswing in suspensions of users with little or no prior content
contributions.

As I, and other moderators, have said before, we do know that these tools aren't perfect. When the policy was handed down to moderators, there was an assertion of testing done on Stack Exchange data regarding the false positives in these detectors. However, no specific information was shared, although the moderators are expecting it to be provided in the near future. The tools were only a single tool used to detect algorithmically-generated post and I'm not aware of any moderators who relied on a tool to tell them that a post was generated.
When it comes to users with little or no prior content and posting content that is not permitted, suspension is letting them off easy. When garbage or spam is posted by accounts with no other valuable contributions, we destroy those accounts. In fact, there are destruction reasons for posting ""spam or nonsense"" without any other ""positive participation"" and for cases where the vast majority of content violates the terms of service. When we take these actions, not only is the account destroyed, but it feeds into

People with original questions and answers were
summarily suspended from participating on the platform. We stand by
our decision to require that moderators stop using that tool. We will
note that it appears to be very rare, however, for mods to use ONLY
the ChatGPT detection tool, and frequently their own analyses were in
use as well. We will continue to look for other, more reasonable tools
and are committed to rapid testing of those tools and any suggested
heuristic indicators.

There is a public admission that moderators used their own analysis. We also used other moderator tools and, in some cases, engaged with moderators from across the network, prior to taking action. Yet the response is to remove a valuable tool from the toolbox. Although there is a false positive rate, the analysis that was shared puts the false positive rate into what I would suspect would be a very tolerable number when combined with other tools, including other detectors.

The moderators who are engaged in this action served this community
collectively for many years on the platform. Personally, I consider a
number of them friends, and anytime friendship is tested like this,
it’s difficult. I would like to say to them clearly that I hope they
know how much I, and the whole staff and community, appreciate their
collective decades of service to this community, and I hope that we
are able to come to a path forward. I regret that actions have
progressed to this point. The Community Management team is evaluating
the current situation and we’re working hard to stabilize things in
the short term. We’ll be working collaboratively with the community on
the long-term solution.

This is not the first time that we've been here. But lessons from the past don't appear to have been learned.

I’ll be honest, the next few days and weeks might be a bit bumpy. Both
sides share a deep and unchanged commitment to quality on this
platform. Additionally, it’s important that we guarantee that anyone
who has meaningful contributions to make has the opportunity to do so.
As we have updates I and the team will be sharing them here.

I - and the moderators that I'm in touch with - are also very committed to the quality of content on the network. We do hope this resolves quickly, but at the same time, want the resolution that's best for our communities.

Reveal to the community the internal AI policy given directly to moderators. The fact that you have made one point in private, and one in public, which differ so significantly has put the moderators in an impossible situation, and made them targets for being accused of being unreasonable, and exaggerating the effect of the new policy. Stack Exchange, Inc. has done the moderators harm by the way this was handled. The company needs to admit to their mistake and be open about this.

I agree that it would absolutely be in the community's interests to be able to read this secret policy. It is completely unreasonable for us to be subject to new rules which can't even be said in public.
If Stack Exchange, Inc. won't allow the policy to be published here, there are other venues which might consider publishing it. (These outlets have written about Stack Overflow's policy on AI content before, so they might run further stories on the same topic.)
To me, it seems inevitable that the secret policy will become available one way or another, so it's just better for everyone if Stack Exchange, Inc. publishes it themselves.

answer,390372,389811,285552.0,Russell McMahon,39,"This is peripheral to the question, but pertinent:
I'm perplexed as to why the company is seeking to destroy itself in this manner.
While a useful amount of AI output is reasonably accurate and useful, a significant portion is either very misleading or entirely fabricated.
ChatGPT will:

Produce totally fake references,
Produce wholly non-existent web links.
Make comments which, when challenged, it will disclaim and say something entirely different.
In some cases contradict itself in the same answer.

The only way to deal with these issues is to either have an expert knowledge greater than the level in the answer, or to use it only as a source for cross referencing.

By allowing essentially uncontrolled use the
company will destroy the integrity of its core asset.

A relevant example:  I am not a Quora member, but I read a significant number of their answers in my (relatively wide) areas of interest. I have been surprised to see some Quora members, obviously using ChatGPT for essentially their whole answers, producing many factually incorrect and hardly relevant answers, but receiving numerous upvotes from other members.
While Quora still contains a very large percentage of genuine and highly useful human-generated answers, it is obvious that they have not chosen to actively oppose the posting of complete rubbish to their site. The likely outcome seems clear.
Why Stack Exchange inc would wish to follow the same path is puzzling.

Added:
The company may be inadvertently ""throwing the baby out with the bathwater"".
The proposed use of AI to improve asked questions has SOME prospect of being useful.
Experienced users can ignore the advice (as long as it is only advice) and many beginners would benefit from good advice.
Worst case, it may make questions worse in some cases (but possibly not too many) and bad questions can be and presently are treated badly.   This would be a negative for newcomers, but it could be ameliorated by thoughtful community action if members are prepared to actively help newcomers. Based on present practices, this seems unlikely; I perceive the site and the majority of member actions creating a substantial barrier for new members. Improving this is hard.
Overall, AI may quite possibly improve questions on average.
This impression may affect the company's perception of AI answer improvement, which is far less likely to be net-positive overall.
One area where I have reservations is the suggested use of AI generated code to improve questions. This is very much a ""double edged sword"" as AI code is often good, but may contain subtle errors leading to 'rubbish out'. If new user code related questions suddenly sprout AI-generated code examples, the quality would need to be extremely high on average to not produce negative reactions overall from the community.

It may have made more sense to offer SE's users and moderators the ability to invest in SE in a funding round than to do so seeking investment from those with little or no understanding of what they purchased, and who come with intellectual baggage or conflicted interests and may or may not wish to dismantle SE or transform it to be unrecognizable.

answer,391689,389811,531408.0,Mark Johnson,8,"As someone who has been working on programing and data analysis on computers since 1981, I am very concerned about allowing people to submit answers that are not a product of their own minds but a product of an artificial intelligence that has simply collected a series individual 'facts', made available by persons unknown, which leads to a conclusion which may (or may not) be plausible.
The same applies to an artificial intelligence (AI) tools checking whether artificial intelligence has created an answer.
That the moderators are not using these tools is, to me at least, obvious, based on their actions that I have observed in the last 6 months.
I myself have flagged/voted many answers that due the style of writing, lack of sources and often very weird constellations of 'facts' making it obvious to me who has the required background knowledge in the topic of the question.
The last 2 weeks the user Serg Z

2023-07-22: User spamming chatbot answers - Mathematics Meta Stack Exchange

on Law and History Stack Exchange, has flooded many existing questions with junk answers.
How should a later reader determine which answer is based on knowledge and facts and which are simply a collection of random facts pasted together by a AI and submitted by a user as if it was their answer?

Below is a email I sent to three friends today.

a Professor of Philosophy from Vancouver, Canada

who is sympathetic to the idea of a central source of knowledge


a US programmer since the mid 1960's for supply automation in the car industry and later debit bookings
the Italian author of a well known PC based Spatial software who I have worked with for many years

I have added this mainly for the benefit of the business leadership of Stack Exchange, Inc. so that can, hopefully, better understand from the viewpoint of a data analysis on computers of many decades that the AI policy should be to treat such answers as a form of plagiarism (and therefore be deleted), since the answer is not a product of the author that submitted the answer.
The ChatGPT experience was from December 2022, where it became clear that the system (at least then) was designed to give an answer at all costs not caring if the result was nonsense or not. This is copy and paste knowledge at its worst.

I was taught that one 'had to learn how to learn'.
One lesson was that one had to have enough background knowledge to determine if any found/returned result was plausible (part of the 'learning' process).
Next, check the sources from preferably multiple -independent- reliable sources.
Finally assume that any result might not be conclusive and that multiple possibilities may exist (often dependent on certain situations).
In 1981, long before the first MS-DOS for PC's were available here, the first lesson in the programming course was: A program will always be as stupid as the person that programmed it (you can't program a bookkeeping program if you know nothing about bookkeeping). Lesson #2: the main difference between a stupid program and a stupid person is that the stupid program is more capable in making more mistakes faster.

Tell this to some people today and you can see the question in their eyes: 'From what alternative universe (far, far, away) does this person come from?'.
This is what is meant with 'a critical lack of tech skills' in the article below.

In the report the tech giant [Google] also highlights what it calls ""a critical lack of tech skills in the UK"", which - if unaddressed - will ""remain a stubborn barrier to equitable nation-wide growth, especially as demand for AI and other tech expertise soars"".


2023-07-28: BBC News - Google: Don't trust what our chatbot Bard tells you

A few years ago, I saw a quote:

With the internet making information available to everyone will make them smarter

well, we got that one wrong didn't we?


As far as I am concerned, for the likes of ChatGPT and Bard, the first two lessons from 1981 still apply.

On History Stack Exchange forum there was a question about a ChatGPT result that the person couldn't make sense of:

2022-12-25: Was there a Moresnet Conference of 1867?

So I tried the ChatGPT system for the first (and only) time to see if I could figure out how ChatGPT came to the result that the OP of the question reported.
My conclusion was that ChatGPT was designed never to say 'I don't know' or 'insufficient results to come to a (sane) conclusion'.
It collected 3 facts that were true for a 3 month period in 1867:

1815-12: Dutch and Prussian representatives created Neutral Moresnet

since 1830 Belgium instead of the Netherlands
existed until 1914


1867-04/06 : International Monetary Conference of 1867 in Paris (Latin Monetary Union)
1867-03-23 / 1867-05-11 Luxembourg Crisis

Thus the 'Moresnet Conference of 1867' (with the participation of The Netherlands, Prussia and Luxembourg - who never belonged to the Latin Monetary Union - and Luxembourg that had nothing to do with Neutral Moresnet) was simply 'created' as a fact, with no supporting sources, hoping that nobody would notice that the answer is nonsense.

A company owns this collection of sites. A corporation has the responsibility, and right, to make their own decisions about their properties' functions and appearance. They are not beholden to their volunteers regarding their decisions.
I have seen complaints about ""firing"" a moderator, the appearance of voting buttons on the sites, and now the disallowance of removal (except in very narrow circumstances) of perceived AI-related posts.
As with any company, I'm sure that Stack Exchange Inc's management has made decisions based on input and findings by their employees as to the best way to proceed.
Just because some volunteers don't like some decisions, and/or the way they were communicated, does not mean the company has to do what the volunteers want done. The company must do what they think is best for their bottom line, including what they think is best for their users.
I personally, and most people I know, have stopped using SO for any new questions because of the combative way we have been treated by some volunteers who believe they know exactly what's right and wrong in every case; who downvote and close questions even when they don't have experience with what's being asked. They're so professional and knowledgeable that they can somehow magically determine whether a question or answer is valid without any experience in the topic.
There are a bunch of companies out in the world, including the creators of ChatGPT, who are trying to find a way to determine whether something was created by AI or a human being. If all of those people can't even determine 100% if something was created by AI, then what extraordinary ability do some SE volunteers have to determine, without a doubt, that a post's information was provided by AI?
OMG: instead of volunteering, you should be getting paid the big bucks for this incredible skill!!!

Update:
After doing some research on Prosus and checking out the SO blog entry from April 2023, Is this the AI renaissance? (Ep. 564): I can say that

Prosus has known about AI and its workings for years.

They have their own AI team.

They have purchased Stack Exchange, Udemy, Codecademy, and other learning sites.


Based on this information, I posit that ""the writing's on the wall"": Prosus is going to be using these sites' data for its own search/learning system that they can possibly hugely monetize. Soon, no more ""volunteers"" needed...
And, if international corporations, like US corporations, are beholden to their shareholders... well, that's why they seem to not care about their volunteers.

Update to clarify my update:
For those who might not understand what I'm saying about shareholders - Prosus, owner of the SE/SO collection of sites, is a public company. ""Public"" means that a company, such as Prosus, provides stocks, aka, a portion of the company that can be purchased by the public or provided to their employees as compensation. The people who own these stocks are called ""stockholders"" or ""shareholders"".
Although these companies are not actually required by law to maximize profit for their shareholders, they often do exactly that - which is why I say ""beholden to their shareholders"".
What I'm saying with the earlier update is that Prosus can, and likely will, find the optimal way to increase their profits in order to satisfy their shareholders. That may include using the purchased assets, such as SE/SO data, to train AI to teach people to code and to answer their questions - which may or may not make the SE/SO (SO, particularly) sites OBE (no longer necessary).
This has nothing whatsoever to do with my non-support of this strike - the reasons for which are in the portion of my post prior to the updates. The updates are merely further information around why the company might not be interested in yielding to the strikers' demands.",,,,

question,389834,,936316.0,Philippe,-589,2023-06-05 18:25:35,"Update: GPT on the platform: Data, actions, and outcomes

As you may be aware, a number of moderators (on Stack Overflow/across the network) have decided to stop engaging in several activities that they had taken on, including moderating content - in fact, almost all moderation tasks. The primary reason for this action is dissatisfaction with our position on detection tools regarding AI-generated content, and discontent with how that was rolled out.
We ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly high rate of false positives, which is correlated to a dramatic upswing in suspensions of users with little or no prior content contributions. People with original questions and answers were summarily suspended from participating on the platform. We stand by our decision to require that moderators stop using that tool. We will note that it appears to be very rare, however, for mods to use ONLY the ChatGPT detection tool, and frequently their own analyses were in use as well. We will continue to look for other, more reasonable tools and are committed to rapid testing of those tools and any suggested heuristic indicators.
The moderators who are engaged in this action served this community collectively for many years on the platform. Personally, I consider a number of them friends, and anytime friendship is tested like this, it’s difficult. I would like to say to them clearly that I hope they know how much I, and the whole staff and community, appreciate their collective decades of service to this community, and I hope that we are able to come to a path forward. I regret that actions have progressed to this point. The Community Management team is evaluating the current situation and we’re working hard to stabilize things in the short term. We’ll be working collaboratively with the community on the long-term solution.
I’ll be honest, the next few days and weeks might be a bit bumpy. Both sides share a deep and unchanged commitment to quality on this platform. Additionally, it’s important that we guarantee that anyone who has meaningful contributions to make has the opportunity to do so.  As we have updates, I and the team will be sharing them here.

People with original questions and answers were summarily suspended from participating on the platform.

We've been asking for data here for a week. As far as I know SE has not provided a single case of an unjustified suspension. Rather the argument has been that it is impossible to detect AI-generated content at all, and therefore it is impossible to produce data on unjustified suspensions here. Which is a very frustrating point to argue against.
This statement here contradicts what SE has told us, it is a statement of fact that alleges that suspensions were unjustified. I expect from SE to back this statement up with data or retract it.

Alas. This is the moment where I miss the times where y'all used to publish Data Science times! (see e.g. November 2018 and December 2018) which not only showed some professional and responsible analysis of the data that you had, but did so in a way which was transparent to the community.
Ever since the announcement of the new policy imposed upon moderators, preventing them from using their skills to handle the surge of AI generated content, there was still no disclosure of the research that would justify it.

ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly high rate of false positives,

Moderators know this, and they do not make decisions based on such tools alone. In fact, some moderators claim that they don't rely on automatic detectors at all. This makes the argument a non sequitur.

which is correlated to a dramatic upswing in suspensions of users with little or no prior content contributions

And rather than interpreting this as ""hey look, a lot of people are creating accounts and posting lots of answers with ChatGPT to exploit the system"", it is appalling that your reaction to this was ""hey look, a lot of people are suddenly interested in contributing to the site and moderators are suspending them for no good reason"". In a scenario where a platform with gamification is already pretty loaded with answers to most questions, and an alternative platform (ChatGPT) is available to quickly obtain answers to the most frequent and simple ones, even Occam's razor would have guided me to the first interpretation. This is the part I would consider not very responsible. And without concrete evidence of undue suspensions taking place, it is also not transparent.
At this point, in the absence of factual data and research to back the claims made, this question would have been a bit more honest if it did not include the second paragraph. Because I understand that ""the damage is done"", and reverting the policy alone won't revert the damage, making that too a bit reckless. I shall wait to see what's coming next.

We ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly high rate of false positives, which is correlated to a dramatic upswing in suspensions of users with little or no prior content contributions.

That is not what that word means. There is no correlation. Quoth Wikipedia:

In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data.

You have observed a fact, and a trend, and believe them to be related. What you have is a hypothesis, and many alternative hypotheses exist. You are playing off the popular conflation of ""correlation"" and ""causation"" to make this sound more impressive than it actually is.



The primary reason for this action is dissatisfaction with our position on detection tools regarding AI-generated content, and discontent with how that was rolled out.

No, that is the primary focus, goal or aim of the strike. It is not the primary reason; merely the proximate cause that broke the camel's back. You are downplaying the myriad reasons – systematic problems stretching back years – that led us to this point.



People with original questions and answers were summarily suspended from participating on the platform.

You have not provided evidence of this. You have been asked repeatedly, and last I heard (from you!), Stack Overflow had no evidence of this. Either substantiate your claims, or retract them.

Your statements to the press, and leaked internal messages, make it clear that this is a deliberate, coordinated campaign of misleading information.



On an unrelated note:



We will continue to look for other, more reasonable tools

We've tried to explain to you that no such tools exist, and no such tools can exist in public (nor be created with the resources available to Stack Overflow). Any non-avalanche discriminator can be run backwards, and used to cause that discriminator to give arbitrary output; and empirically, most transformer-based tools can fool most other transformer-based tools.
If you do not understand this by now, you as a company do not have the expertise to be working with AI.

and any suggested heuristic indicators.

I can confirm that this, at least, isn't made up. Discussions about heuristic indicators have occurred, where suggestions have been made, and the CMs have been looking through those discussions (and even participating).



I regret that actions have progressed to this point.

We know that you, personally do, Philippe. But the company overall does not appear to regret it sufficiently; or else it would have acted on that regret.

No, it isn't, and I think the community would appreciate if you didn't misrepresent the actual reasons for the strike, which have been clearly expressed. The primary reason for the strike is because Stack Exchange, Inc. has imposed a secret policy which de facto allows behaviour which the community overwhelmingly thinks should not be allowed.
That is, regardless of whether ""detection tools"", subject matter knowledge and experience, the user's post history, post frequency, or other evidence shows that a user has plagiarised from an AI tool, the users caught doing it can't be suspended.
You have nothing to gain from lying to us about our own motivations, so honestly this looks more like you are talking past us, and lying to some other audience about us.

I will remind you that the position we are dissatisfied with comprises not just the public position on detection tools, but very importantly the broader policy and interpretation, made clear only in private, that goes far beyond particular detection tools and effectively forbids treating the vast majority of AI-generated content as unwelcome on our sites, overruling community-determined policies on individual network sites.

Also note that unless otherwise stated whenever I say ""you"" I am referring to the company as a whole and not to any specific individuals.
Premise
Let's just start with a simple premise. I no longer trust your words when you say that you didn't expect this, when you say you are sad about the outcome and so on.
I don't trust you. I can't trust you any longer after every single time you shove in our face the same theatrical act, with the same characters, the same plot, and the same twists.
Don't get what I am talking about?
Stack Exchange Scandals 101: a proven formula
Historically, most recent scandals have been following the same formula, with some minor changes every now and then.

The staff announces some controversial changes out of nowhere. The announcement is usually made on Meta.SE and it is carefully crafted to be as invisible as it can imaginably be to the rest of the network. Optionally, the post is made because some meddling user caught the company red-handed. If an official post is made, it will be written in the most confusing way possible so that users won't even be able to agree on what was said (""did they want to prohibit moderation of AI generated content"" VS ""did they suggest to stop using detector tool until we can work out a better policy"" is just a recent case).
Corollary: whenever possible, the user base is expected to get only an incomplete picture of the issue. If applicable, mods will get some full guidance that contains the more controversial parts that they will be required not to share.
The announcement is met with a huge backlash as multiple users start posting related questions on Meta. The company enters the ""silence"" phase — no answer is given, no comment posted, no ""we heard you, please give us time to write back"" is said. This phase usually lasts a few days as the company ""sits-out"" on the issue while letting the bigger fires die down.
(Optional: while ignoring its own community, the company still finds time to talk with some external media news site and publish a misrepresentation of the reality that constitutes actual slander against a single or a whole category of users. Most of the time this seems to be done as a PR move to show that the company is doing their best on social issues.)
After some time the company comes out with a ""We are aware of the issue"" post that on surface looks not completely unlike an apology. Under more careful scrutiny it is more often than not a non-apology in the form of ""I am sorry if you were offended"" or an indirect attempt to share the blame like ""It is sad that we escalated so far"". The post also carefully avoids giving out any info about what is planned to do to actually resolve the problem.
At the same time the users start to plan their action: sometimes this can involve an actual moderation strike or users using their profile to spread the word.
In a desperate attempt to reduce the visibility of the protest, SE revokes the right that was given to mods to advertise posts that they deemed important for the community to see. Removing links for a solidarity fundraising campaign from users' profiles, unfeaturing posts, anything goes in this step.
The fire continues until the company concedes on some (minor) details. More often than not this is not a real win for the community, just an ""it is better than nothing"" scenario with most users preferring to accept whatever little Scoobie Snack the company dispensed instead of going into an endless fight.  Sometime it may even go as far as look like a fake concession that was already planned to make the userbase more yielding in whatever negotiation is going on at the time.
The company then starts a final memory-clearing campaign. The community will be rendered unable to fully know what actually happened, sometimes even going as far as to use law to be sure that no one can disclose the full picture by force-handing the actual victims into silence.

Obviously any new tire fire is different, but I expect them to more-or-less follow this same script. And with that behind us, let's move on to...
A Bastard's explanation (yep, that's me)
I know that what will follow will be seen as evil by some users. ""Never assume ill intent"" they will say.
Yet let me also tell you that there is an old saying that goes like ""Once is ingenuity, twice is stupidity, three times is malice"" or, if you prefer another version, Hotoke no kao mo sando - ""Even with a Buddha nature (you can forgive) only three times"".
With that said, feel free to downvote the following if you wish, but I will try to explain what all of this feels like and why I think history keeps repeating itself.
Assumption #1: the attempt to make problematic posts less visible is deliberate
First of all, let's start with a basic assumption: the company knows in advance what topics will cause backlash. It is quite evident from how they are presented. Why is there no secrecy involved when they announce some new feature they are proud of, or when the company makes some donation to charity? At the same time, things like unilateral changes to existing content licensing are posted without any attempt to actually make them visible and followed by a total silence while waiting for the bigger flames to go down.
Assumption #2: the actual motivations are never the ones being told
Let's go a little further. We know that the company knows that whatever they are going to post is problematic. But how can they be so sure that it will be problematic?
There are only two possible answers:

The issue can be easily misunderstood, but if that is the case I would expect that instead of closing up into silence you would want to try to clear up confusion. Why keep your users angry if you really think that you can agree?
The issue is clearly going against the will of most users, either by removing their agency to moderate content, by shoehorning unwanted content on them, or other similar things.

Since I don't think the company is stupid I will have to exclude the first irrational behavior. That leaves us with the second one.
Assumption #3: the company already knows in advance how the users will react and then try to act surprised when it goes that way
This is just a direct consequence of what we just said and is confirmed by the fact that the scripted non-apology post will usually contain some carefully written lines to look surprised, like ""We didn't expect this"" or even better ""We didn't expect we (== you) would actually escalate to this"".
You can see where this is going.
And a Tin Foil Hat one: the hidden agenda
By this point I have to admit that all so far gives a fairly bleak picture.
Thinking back at how Monica was picked out and slandered on a news site, thinking about how the company apologized for that only to do that again now, and looking at how users now even have to say that ""actually they never promised to not slander user groups anymore, only individuals"".

I can not reasonably avoid seeing some form of actual malice at work here: it is my blunt conclusion that none of these changes were actually made in the interest of improving the site content or the user experience.
What I see instead is a reiterated attempt at pleasing the stakeholders in the worst ways possible.
The Monica case was never resolved, and still today it looks like Monica was just a carefully picked scapegoat that the company decided to use to get some free advertisement in an attempt to present itself as caring for the rights of the LGBT+ community that not only backfired on them but also on the ones it was supposed to protect by further fueling rage and abuse.
Years later we now had to resort once again to a new moderation strike, and once again we see the company name-calling its mods to put the blame on them. Once again we see them post multiple inaccurate representations of mods' actions on the Internet to shame them and circulate the message that ""The company is improving even if some (bad) mods are trying to fight back"". And I admit that I went as far as to expect someone to be used as the scapegoat again to be the new Monica.
Sadly, I don't think that I am just hallucinating things as the feeling that these actions are part of a hidden agenda that not only is willing to go against the users for the sake of profit but is also quite open to publicly shame and even sacrifice them, seems to be quite a shared sentiment nowadays based on the comments I read on the site. Promises are usually made to stop the fighting but personally I find it rather unclear whether those are actual concession the company had to make, or just planned eye-candy, smoke and mirrors, used to make the userbase yield and accept the ""better than nothing"" resolution.
Also it is not unusual for the company to hide themselves behind grammatical technicalities worth of the ""Evil Overlord"" manual: after all, after the Monica scandal they just promised to never again slander an individual on the Internet, so slandering all the moderators is fine, right?
Conclusion
Over the course of the last years, the company has made their moves to show off how nice they are, how they care about defending others, how they work on social issues. Things like the Be Nice policy, revising how new users are guided in their first steps... all great things. On paper.
Yet, in the current scenario I can't see them as anything other than empty actions that didn't actually come from the heart but just from a need to ""show off"", to get media to talk about how Stack is doing the right thing, to win more users -> more ads views -> more money.
At the same time the userbase is portrayed as the enemy, whose toxicity causes nightmares, and who makes newcomers feel unwanted and leave.
I'll ask you a question...
Have you ever thought about the nightmares Monica probably had? Ever considered the users that went off the site after each of these scandals to never return? Ever listened to the mods asking you to not be toxic to them?
Once again, I ask you to stop and reconsider. You can work with the users and you can choose to make actual improvements together. The media awareness that you are ""good"" needs to be an effect of your good actions, not the target that you have to reach by any means by faking things — then happy users will suggest your site to their friends. Currently, the only thing I can suggest is to never get involved with an actual account here.

I'm probably wasting my breath, because I tried to make these points in 2019 when I was a mod. Maybe repeating them will help.

Stop making official policy statements off the cuff in the Teacher's Lounge. That chat room should be for mods to get support from each other and the company, not for official company policy setting. Not every moderator participates in that chat room and chat messages are inherently a terrible channel for official announcements.

The company should make it clear that participating in chat is optional, and that mods who don't will still be included when discussing and distributing official company policy.

Stop making unsupported assertions disparaging volunteer moderators in the press. Surely you can talk about what you believe is good for the future of the company without throwing the volunteers who made Stack Exchange the success it is today under the bus.

The data behind the assertions that new users were being unfairly suspended by moderators should be made public, or the assertion should be retracted and apologized for.

Do not unfeature posts on site metas. It doesn't help contain or stabilize the situation; It just makes people angrier and more frustrated.

There should be a process that's followed prior to staff reversing the actions of site moderators and the first step should be a conversation with the moderators.

Stop treating volunteer moderators like they work for the company. Site moderators are elected representatives of their communities, not extra labor that can be directed to achieve the company's goals. They know what their communities need to stay healthy, and rightly prioritize that.

The company should not be dictating policies intended to prevent moderators from using their judgment to do what is best for their communities. Either the mods can be trusted or they can't. If the company can't persuade the experts that a course of action is good for their community, maybe it's a bad idea.
A few parting thoughts
The company does not act like they value the expertise and dedication of the volunteer moderators as a whole. Individual staff may be friendly with individual moderators, but that does not translate into the company including the community and their elected moderators as partners in business decisions that impact them. Many of the veteran moderators are as (if not more) invested in the success of Stack Exchange as the shareholders and management.
Maybe moderators should join together in a formal independent organization that can speak with one voice to the company for its members. That might make it easier for the company to hear their advice on various policy decisions before things escalate.",,,

answer,389851,389834,1438.0,Jon Ericson,74,2023-06-05 21:48:07,"Apparently people have been upvoting spam. I don't know if this is an isolated thing or a coordinated effort, but it's not at all helpful. Indeed, I'd suggest that CMs consider warning and (if not heeded) suspending people who upvote obvious spam. It's functionally the same as a voting ring after all. Personally I find that behavior counter-productive to the reasons I signed the letter.
I got to thinking about voting rings because they present similar problems to detecting machine-generated content. It's less of a binary switch and more of a Bayesian inference. My memory might be fuzzy, but here's how voting ring investigations typically went down:

A user would flag posts that seem to be getting more upvotes than expected.
A moderator would see that flag and look into the situation using moderator tools built into the site. They'd also bring experience and past history into their judgements.
If the moderator thought it worth more investigation, they'd contact a CM to (potentially) invalidate votes.
We'd use a variety of tools and techniques passed on from one CM to another (thanks Shog and Tim!) to make a final determination.
If, in our judgment, voting fraud had taken place, we'd invalidate some votes and message the users we suspected of being in the ring.
The users would deny that they'd done what we said they did.

Each step would increase or decrease confidence that voting fraud had happened. For instance, an overly-aggressive flagger might decrease our estimate of the odds because they cry wolf so often. In my experience, moderators usually identified voting rings accurately, so when they brought one to my attention, it raised my estimate considerably. Some of the tools were extremely reliable and others weren't worth listening to most of the time. You learned to make these evaluations only through experience.
I remember one time we'd caught a pair of users dead-to-rights. One of the users (we'll call them A) said they had no idea what had happened. The other user (B) confessed that they were married to A, saw that A's posts were getting downvoted and upvoted all of A's posts to help them feel better. Now. That's a textbook voting ring, but I wanted to give that couple a hug and let them off the hook. We invalidated the votes anyway and told B to maybe try something else to cheer up A.
We'd also see things like two experts in a specific technology upvoting each other's posts. If we just used the voting fraud tools, we'd be compelled to suspend them. Another time we applied one of our tools to employees voting on Meta and found that the voting ring was coming from inside the house! Since we didn't just blindly do what the voting fraud tools recommended, it was an inside joke rather than a soul-searching investigation. Context matters so much!

We ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly high rate of false positives, which is correlated to a dramatic upswing in suspensions of users with little or no prior content contributions. People with original questions and answers were summarily suspended from participating on the platform.

One of the things that has made this issue go from 0 to 100 in a week is that we haven't seen any details of this analysis. Like the vote fraud tools I just mentioned, false positives are not surprising if used in an inappropriate context. In my experimentation with GPT and GPT detectors, I found that my own original writing could be flagged as likely machine generated. So that's not news.
What would be news is if we could see evidence of moderators blindly using GPT detectors without other signals to make their decisions. That sort of behavior is not unheard of, but its rare on Stack Exchange sites. Moderators here tend to be extremely diligent. Given the volume of flags, mistakes are inevitable, but most moderators are quick to own up to them when confronted. That's one of my priors that makes me suspicious of the analysis even before it's made public.
The final sentence about ""original questions and answers"" also raises red flags for me. I guess what bugs me is that if your standard is ""original"" you can't go far wrong with machine-generated content. How many times have you searched for something (recipes are particular offenders), found a promising page and then scroll (and scroll) until you find the actual information you need? (I get it! You spent a summer in Tuscany and that's how you know so much about spaghetti carbonara.) Since it's so easy to generate reams and reams of verbiage using ChatGPT, ""original"" seems to skew the playing field away from (most) humans.
I don't know if this is intentional, but the most recent CEO blog post (CEO Update: Paving the road forward with AI and community at the center) seems to argue that people in the community serve AI rather than the other way around:

Our community has given us feedback through the evolution of this tool, and their feedback is critical to how it scales. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, the need for communities that can nurture, inform, and challenge these technologies becomes paramount. These platforms will not only offer the necessary guidance to refine AI algorithms and models but also serve as a space for healthy debate and exchange of ideas, fostering the spirit of innovation and pushing the boundaries of what AI can accomplish.

The words are fine, but in the context of disagreement between moderators and the company about how to moderate machine-generated content, it sounds dismissive. It's as if the company believe it would be making great strides in technological development if only those pesky humans would get on board. Or maybe I'm being unfair and this is just an ""AI meets community"" pitch. (I suppose I'm not the audience for the CEO's blog, though.)
I agree that one value of communities is improving a product. But that doesn't happen if the community isn't free to reject the product or wait until it's reached some level of maturity. When the community signals that ""original"" content isn't enough, it doesn't do the product any good to ignore that signal. Because with few exceptions, the people who curate content on Stack Overflow also consume it.",,,

The Community Management team is evaluating the current situation and we’re working hard to stabilize things in the short term.

If, by ""short-term stabilization,"" you mean ending the moderators' and curators' strike, then the solution is relatively simple: Just apologize – publicly and unreservedly – for the confusing and insulting manner in which this so-called policy change was announced: privately (to the moderators) and publicly (in a way that was at odds with the private announcement).

I regret that actions have progressed to this point.

Although this may be considered the seed of a beginning of a vague apology, it simply doesn't go far enough. Also, it carries an implicit hint that the moderator team has played a significant part in creating this mess – which it hasn't.

We’ll be working collaboratively with the community on the long-term solution.

This ""community collaboration"" should have been present from the get-go (as it was when first implementing the ban on AI-generated content). Maybe it is now time to hit the ""rewind"" button and ask for suggestions on how to address the (unsurprising) ""large upswing"" in account suspensions.
In the meantime, restore the moderators' rights to use suspensions (the vast majority of which, I gather, have been for periods of seven days or shorter). You (the staff) need to trust your moderators to not issue suspensions (of any length) trivially and without full consideration. In the longer term, there may be a way to avoid such suspensions by using and/or fine-tuning the in-built ""answer ban"" system, instead; from what I understand about that (the details of its algorithms are, understandably, kept secret), this can actually work out to be a more effective ""blocking tool"" than a suspension, as it is: (a) potentially for an unlimited time period; and (b) covers all posts from a given IP address.

answer,389853,389834,,user393600,43,2023-06-05 22:35:47,"Which other groups’ interests are missing from this post?
In many complex subjects a number of constituencies need to be considered.
From this post, one can identify the following groups/interests:

moderators

users that are, correctly, or possibly incorrectly, flagged as having gone against the rules.

implicitly Stack Exchange, Inc. corporate interests.  While others may want to dismiss those I will say that, for all the complaints, the family of Stack Exchange sites have been of tremendous value to professionals and hobbyists all around.  Second, a corporation that does not have a plan to make money, or at least fund itself according to expectations, risks disappearing or takeover.


However two other groups are missing and are very much impacted by this policy:
First, users that come to SE looking for answers to a problem that they have.
Stack Overflow, while sometimes criticized for fostering cut and paste programming, generally fits the bill.  Some primary ways to judge the quality of answers are:  your own knowledge, the up down votes, the presentation of an answer, along with supporting quotes and program outputs and the poster's reputation.  Even if the poster is not the most competent on the subject, a user can assume repeat research and posting will gradually have improved their knowledge.
With AI allowing cheaply-produced, but perfectly worded answers, neither the presentation, nor the poster's reputation has any great meaning, leaving the user to their own to judge how helpful an answer is liable to be, except for community upvotes which can be swayed by confidence and presentation, something generative AI excels at.
Respectfully, that constituency is not benefiting in the least from your proposed hands-off approach.
And, much more so than just the moderators, if regular users cease to see Stack Overflow as a valid source of information, they will go elsewhere.
Second, users that answer questions.
Their motivation may vary from reputation seeking, interest, evangelism, desire to help, challenge, pursuit of professional credibility.
They decide to join SE sites and ""grind"" their way up, by answering question after question.
How is that group likely to react to a situation where they are systematically pre-empted by people who can write up a complex and perfectly-formatted answer - that they often don't really understand and don't bother vetting - in 5 minutes or less?  While it takes even a knowledgeable person 3x the time to write up a concise answer, with some minimal code and showing output?
Like the first group, it is quite possible they will not bother.  And without a solid core of them, there is no site.
Though it is a very imperfect comparison, I would note that schools that have, for whatever reason, taken a relaxed attitude towards cheating, and academic standards in general often end up devalued as a result:  in the eyes of prospective students, and in those of prospective employers.
Generative AI content is going to be a big challenge, for this site, and others.  You have indicated concerns with moderator measures as done so far.
Fine, to an extent. Work together on a better solution. But the answer is most certainly not throwing out AI content moderation as a whole.
The striking moderators, to me, ultimately seem to be motivated by looking after users in the largest sense:  regular users posting questions and answers, without using shortcuts, and especially not knowingly using shortcuts with well-known imperfections at the current time.
As a regular, non-moderator, not particularly ""community"" minded, user, I would strongly encourage SE, Inc. to do the same:  do well by your users.
Better said on this answer:
p.s. I intentionally stayed out of considerations about communication issues, perceived or real shortcomings in how moderators were treated, community stewardship, etc….  I do have my opinions, but I wanted to keep the focus on why the proposed policy is bad for regular users and a better collaborative solution needs to be found.",,,

This means I have no access to the ""private policies"" behind this. The upside is, I have no obligation or commitment to non-disclosure. On the other hand, everything to follow is by its nature speculative.
Edit: Update: Since writing this I have read a number of other related meta questions and answers, authored by both community members and staff. I also finally read the moderators' strike letter. Importantly, I have still not seen any ""secret"" materials. Nonetheless, at this time, I feel confident saying I was correct below, regarding the secret policy. SE Inc is very likely preventing moderators from removing posts that violate our community expectations, and harm the health of the community as a whole. Thus I have also since signed in support of their open letter.
From the body of the official ""question"", one might be forgiven for thinking that mods were in an uproar over ""access to a [flawed] tool"". You skillfully framed the issue as a move to protect the community from self-inflicted harm. However, having observed the community reactions to past debacles like this, the story simply isn't credible. Such a massive strike would only be undertaken if the policy issue were truly existential. Something is missing. Even without the other comments here, we might guess what that is: some ""private policy"" which mods feel bound to withhold [but which I'm free to speculate about].
So what is this secret new policy direction? Well, we can actually just read between the lines of the official statement, applying a basic understanding of standard PR tactics. This is clearly a deflection, and those work best to defuse a reaction if they are focused on something ""innocuous"" which is very near to the true subject. This is to avoid a sense of ""narrative novelty"" when people encounter discussions of the ""real"" issue, in hopes they'll dismiss it without consideration as something they've already evaluated. By this reasoning, we might say it likely has something to do with AI generated submissions.
Now the cynic in me comes out, and I ask myself ""Why would SE want to hide this policy shift?"" After all the community issues of the past few years, surely anything so contentious as to prompt mass strike would have been appropriate to discuss openly first? If they're playing the corporate trump card, and trying to gag the mods, then it must surely be rooted in profit motive. So really the question to ask is ""What does SE or it's leadership think they stand to lose (or gain) in this area?""
Bringing this all together, I feel pretty confident hazarding a guess as to the policy, and mindset of the SE side:
Basically, they don't want AI generated content removed at all, unless it's so flagrant as to make the site appear useless.
Their reasoning is likely based in a combination of factors, ranging from fear of direct competition by AI tools to a more straight-forward play to assuage investor concerns about userbase growth. It's also likely they want to feel free to lean into that themselves eventually, and use AI tools to answer questions directly. The cynic in me wonders if they already tried it without telling anyone, but so far I haven't seen anything to suggest it. In any case, from a ""catalog"" management perspective, I'm sure they see having generated answers to orphan questions as better than having none, and more ""active users"" as better than fewer. It's easy to see why they might view moderator efforts to remove AI ""contributions"" as a nuisance to their bottom line.
Again, I could be completely off-base. But if I'm not, this is a serious error on the part of SE, and I hope they recognize this and reverse course in time.
From a business perspective, this move may appear savvy on the surface, but it actally is an act of brutal self-sabotage. The value of SE isn't being the place with all the answers. It's the community. Disregarding it in this way can only erode any long-term value you hope to create in the company. As a ""regular end user"", I'm watching this with an eye towards walking away entirely (and advising everyone I know to do the same).
Whatever is going on, now is the time for honesty and transparency. The idea that mods here are being coerced into hiding any policy at all does not sit well with me. Tread carefully SE.

We ran an analysis and the ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly high rate of false positives, which is correlated to a dramatic upswing in suspensions of users with little or no prior content contributions. People with original questions and answers were summarily suspended from participating on the platform. We stand by our decision to require that moderators stop using that tool.

I think this is a serious concern that should be addressed, but I think it also misses the point a little bit.
The main reason I signed the letter (something I rarely do) is the heavy-handed approach that seemed to have been taken. I think your concerns are completely valid and very much should be raised, but on the other hand moderators are also struggling with ""ChatGPT spam"". I don't really know what a good solution for that would look like exactly, but I do know that a heavy-handed ""we have decreed that ..."" is not it. It's a difficult problem and there are no quick and easy solutions.
It's not really about the ""ChatGPT policy"" or whether or not these tools are good or bad per se, it's about a mismatch between ""we're all in this together and let's decide together what the best course of action is"" vs. ""we decided, end of discussion"" (crudely put). Moderators are volunteering their time and in return it's understood they have some say in policy. You can't ""just"" order people like they're employees, so you need to spend time and effort convincing people you're right. This is work, but still cheaper than paying people to moderate the site. And sure, in the end Stack Overflow Inc. has the final say and that's fine, but if you're not even spending the effort...

As for this specific policy, it seems to me that the problem is that moderators are suspending users based on too little evidence and are, apparently, not taking the full situation in to account when making their decision, relying too much on the output of a single tool. I can't really judge how often that happens, but it certainly seems more than plausible that moderators have made mistakes here and that's obviously not a good thing, but the alternative is a fuzzy ""this looks like ChatGPT"" underbelly feeling, and that'll have a lot of false positives too – perhaps even more? I've certainly seen plenty of ""ChatGPT paranoia"" around, and most of this probably didn't use any tools.
The tool is not the problem; ""How do we deal with ChatGPT?"" is the problem, and as far as I can tell, there is no good solution right now. Any tool can be used inappropriately. If there is a problem with moderators making bad decisions then that should be taken up with those specific moderators.
For what it's worth, personally I don't even think using ChatGPT is necessarily bad in and of itself; see my other answer. I'm all for judging posts more ""holistically"" rather than just ""you're using ChatGPT!"" as that seems too simplistic. It's really about the heavy-handed approach as far as I'm concerned.

Edit: thinking about this some more, I'm also reminded how conflicts were handled in the past. I was involved in the launching of the Vi & Vim site quite a bit and a number of employees were pretty strongly against the concept initially. But the disagreement played out different: it was well argued, and we were allowed a chance to prove ""you're wrong"", and this turned out well.
The controversial Stack Overflow Documentation effort also springs to mind; I felt it wasn't the right direction, but Jon Ericson tried very hard to make it work by engaging with the community and I always very much appreciated that (even though the community was overly harsh at times, to the point I felt rather bad for Jon).
I'm not saying any of this is easy or that the People of Stack Exchange can't be a difficult bunch to deal with – they can – but that's kind of what you get when you rely on volunteers.
In comparison, this feels like ... bland marketing-speak. I get that community management is hard, but by being bland and generic you're not really engaging with anything substantial and nothing ever gets hashed out.

Again, are you aware of specific individuals that you know for a fact were incorrectly suspended? How did you determine that, unless you yourselves have a way to reliably distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated AI? If you don't have a way to do that, aren't you kind of doing the same thing you're accusing moderators of doing?

I have on SU detected and signaled 5 cases of AI ""answers"", with
confirmation in all cases by the moderators and even sometimes by
the poster himself.
In the first two cases, I used no tools. For the next three cases,
I discovered ZeroGPT and GPTZero and used them for a second opinion.
In other words, I have used the tools not for detecting AI answers,
but for detecting whether I was wrong in assuming the answer
was by AI.
No one runs all the answers through ZeroGPT and GPTZero to detect
AI answers for fun. One only goes to this effort when the answer
seems weird, without a central theme, with a very weak or
no connection to the question and even sometimes just plain wrong
and misleading.
The tools are used just the opposite of that postulated by SE : To
check whether the answers are not AI.",,,

The concerns expressed by the moderators regarding the detection tools and AI-generated content on Stack Overflow are valid and should not be dismissed. While it is unfortunate that some moderators have chosen to disengage from their moderation tasks, their actions highlight the seriousness of the issue at hand.
The claim that the ChatGPT detection tools have an alarmingly high rate of false positives is questionable. Detection tools, including AI algorithms, are not infallible, and false positives can occur. However, it is essential to consider the overall impact of these false positives and weigh them against the potential harm of allowing AI-generated content to proliferate unchecked. The purpose of such tools is to maintain the quality and integrity of the platform, even if there are occasional false positives that need to be addressed.
The suggestion that suspensions were imposed on users with little or no prior content contributions solely based on ChatGPT's detection tool is misleading. Moderators typically employ multiple methods and analyses to make informed decisions. While ChatGPT's detection tool may have been part of the process, it is not the sole determinant of suspensions. The goal is to ensure a safe and reliable platform for users, which sometimes requires precautionary measures.
The statement about seeking other, more reasonable tools and commitment to rapid testing of those tools is encouraging. It shows a willingness to address the concerns raised by the moderators and find better solutions for content moderation. Continuous improvement and adaptation to new challenges are essential for any platform to thrive.
Expressing appreciation for the moderators' years of service and acknowledging the difficulty of the situation is a positive gesture. However, it is important to focus on resolving the underlying issues and finding a viable path forward. Merely expressing regret and hoping for a resolution may not be sufficient. Concrete actions need to be taken to address the moderators' concerns and restore trust within the community.
While it is acknowledged that the upcoming days and weeks may be challenging, both sides should prioritize open dialogue and collaboration. Ensuring quality and inclusivity on the platform should be the shared goal. Transparent communication with the community about updates and progress is crucial for rebuilding trust and working towards a long-term solution.
In conclusion, it is crucial to acknowledge the concerns raised by the moderators and address them seriously. Balancing the need for effective content moderation with minimizing false positives is a complex task, but it should be approached with a commitment to finding the best possible solutions for all stakeholders involved.",,,
